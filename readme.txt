WP Marketing is a suite of high-converting tools that help you to engage your visitors, personalize customer connections, and boost your profits.

== Description ==

**What can you do with WP Marketing?**

WP Marketing CTAs are useful to: collect contact information, offer a free download, opt-in to your newsletter, collect call-back phone numbers, boost social sharing, and more.

Is there a marketer in the world who wouldn't want beautiful, high-converting lead-generators at their fingertips?

A *GREAT* marketing tool can have 100x more ROI than a *GOOD* marketing tool. If you're like us, you're always on the lookout for small investments that grow your business and your bottom line - *quickly*.

Of course, the real power of Call-To-Actions happens when you put MULTIPLE CTAs to work for you.

**Right now, we're offering [UNLIMITED CTAs for only $99 USD](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=NX9NZCDNRD3CC) (1 site).**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is WP Marketing? =
* You know those boxes on website that tempt you with a free download, contact info, or to subscribe to your newsletter? That's WP Marketing. We offer many different styles (with custom colouring), many different placements, and many different actions (eg. free download, contact form, newsletter subscription, call back, etc.).

= Do you integrate with Mailchimp, Aweber, and other third parties? =
* Currently, we can sync submitted information with Aweber and Mailchimp, and we're working on more integrations. Let us know if you're looking for a particular service (dallas@wpmarketing.guru)!

= What am I missing out on by not unlocking WP Marketing? =
* WPMarketing, as a basic plugin, will always be free. The Free version of WPMarketing has a 1-CTA Limit; the Unlocked version allows unlimited Call-To-Actions. Free WPMarketing has limited access to our Call-To-Actions. The Unlocked version includes Social Shares, Call Me Back, Poll, and Comment Stream - to name a few.

= How often do you add new CTAs, features, or updated the plugin? =
* Our feature releases aren't on a rigid schedule - we want to make sure they're incredibly useful, easy-to-use, and bug-free. Typically, they'll range from once a week to once a month.

= How can I create a sidebar widget to collect email addresses? =
* Create a new CTA, that has a style of "Inline". Then, visit the Appearance > Widgets page and drag the WP Marketing widget to your sidebar. Select the CTA from the drop down menu and click save! If its not showing up, make sure that your CTA is set to show on page load.
